# Heart Disease Prediction  (mini project)

A simple machine learning-based web app built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical input features.

## Features
- Uses a KNN model to predict heart disease risk
- Web interface built using Streamlit
- Model trained on heart disease dataset

## Files
- `HeartdiseaseFinal.ipynb`: Training and evaluation
- `app.py`: Streamlit web app
- `heart.csv`: Dataset
- `knn_heart_model.pkl`: Trained model
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Run
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run app.py
